			<h1>Professional Experience</h1>
			<p>
				I have Joined as a fresher in TCS.
				<br>
				Before joining in TCS I don't have any programming knowldge at all.
				So it took more time to cope with IT industry.
				<br><br>
				But what I feel is if we get a proper team to work, there is more scope to learn and do things in IT sector.
				And before starting any task, if we go around the task and understand about the task, it helps to code quickly and properly.
				Above all from my Professional experience what I understand is if we have knowledge we will get repect from others.
