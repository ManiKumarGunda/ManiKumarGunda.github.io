			<p>
			Hi this is Mani Kumar,<br>
			<br>
			Currently I am working as a software developer in Hyderabad.
			I had my graduation in Mechanical Engeneering from RVR&JC College of Engeneering Guntur.
			My home town is Macherla.I had my schooling there itself.<br><br>
			My intrests are watching movies,reading books,knowing about places.
			I am not a continuous reader.I like to read books in my mother tongue, because I feel, if I read in my language, my involovement is very good.<br><br>
			Also I  am interested in reading short stories.
			Weekly twice or thrice, I will go for Jog.
			What I feel is to have a flexible body, exercise and diet playa an important role in our life.
